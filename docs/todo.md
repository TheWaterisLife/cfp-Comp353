## CFP Issue Tracker / TODO (Markdown)

This file acts as a lightweight issue tracker for environments without GitHub/GitLab issues.

### Global Checklist

- [x] Phase 0 — Kickoff & repo scaffold
- [x] Phase 1 — Requirements → ERD → Relational schema
- [x] Phase 2 — Database initialization + seed data
- [x] Phase 3 — Basic backend & auth
- [x] Phase 4 — Frontend UI & UX
- [x] Phase 5 — Business workflows & anti-plagiarism process
- [x] Phase 6 — Statistics, reporting, and simulated email
- [x] Phase 7 — Testing, documentation, demo script & packaging

### Phase 0 — Kickoff & Repo Scaffold

- [x] Initialize Git repo with `main` and `phase0-init` branches
- [x] Create base directory structure (`db`, `src`, `assets`, `docs`, role folders)
- [x] Add `README.md` with project overview and phase list
- [x] Add `INSTALL.md` stub
- [x] Create empty `db/schema.sql` and `db/seed.sql`
- [x] Add `docs/design_notes.md` and `docs/demo_script.md` stubs
- [x] Add `docs/ERD.png` placeholder (keep synced with `db/schema.sql`)
- [x] Add supporting documentation: glossary, questions & assumptions, bug log, known limitations

Update this checklist as future phases are implemented and tested. For post-phase-7 enhancements, track work items in this file or in `docs/bug_fixes.md`.
