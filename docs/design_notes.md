## CFP Design Notes

This document will capture the evolving design of the CopyForward Publishing (CFP) system.

### Scope

- ERD and relational schema rationale
- Normalization (3NF) justification
- Business rules (downloads, donations, plagiarism handling)
- Architectural and implementation decisions

Details will be added starting in **Phase 1** when the ERD and schema are finalized, and updated in later phases as workflows and features are implemented.
